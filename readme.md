## 🎯 Project Overview

Rapid-Zip is a mathematical image compression system that addresses the challenge of storing high-resolution images efficiently. By combining frequency-domain transforms with entropy encoding, we achieve significant file size reduction while maintaining perceptual image quality.

### The Problem
High-resolution PNG images contain substantial redundant information, leading to unnecessarily large file sizes that consume storage and bandwidth. Traditional compression methods either lose too much quality or don't compress enough.

### Our Solution
A hybrid compression pipeline that intelligently removes perceptually redundant data through:
- **Transform-based reduction** using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

- **Entropy-based encoding** using Heap-based Huffman Coding
- **Smart quantization** for controlled quality-to-size tradeoff

### Compression Pipeline

### Compression Pipeline

```
PNG/JPG Input → RGB to YCbCr → 8×8 Blocks → DCT → Quantization 
→ Zig-Zag Scan → RLE → Huffman Coding → .mcmp2 Output
```

### Decompression Pipeline

```
.mcmp2 Input → Huffman Decode → RLE Decode → Inverse Zig-Zag 
→ Dequantization → Inverse DCT → Block Reassembly → PNG Output
```

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundation

### Core Algorithm: 2D Discrete Cosine Transform

The DCT converts spatial image data into frequency coefficients, where high frequencies (fine details) can be discarded with minimal perceptual loss:

$$
F(u,v) = \frac{1}{4} C(u)C(v) \sum_{x=0}^{7}\sum_{y=0}^{7} f(x,y) \cos\left[\frac{(2x+1)u\pi}{16}\right]\cos\left[\frac{(2y+1)v\pi}{16}\right]
$$

Where $C(u) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ if $u = 0$, else $1$.

### Key Techniques
